# Sky VeLor — Beta-0.10.6v

Sky VeLor is a client-side Forge mod for Minecraft 1.8.9. It provides a configurable HUD, a settings hub, dungeon utilities, Spirit Leap helpers, fishing and Slayer trackers, and quick notes.

## Features

- Settings hub and movable HUD editor with dark and light themes.
- Smooth, frame-rate-independent UI motion: soft hover and press feedback, animated toggles and sliders, a sliding segmented selector, a gently appearing dropdown, and responsive search-field focus.
- Rounded animated buttons in the main/pause menu and Quick Note screen, with distinct primary, secondary and destructive styles.
- Spirit Leap teammate picker, class labels, player heads and isolated preview.
- Dungeon mob highlights, Floor VII overlays and dragon alerts.
- Fishing and Slayer trackers, plus quick notes and client commands.

## Requirements

- Minecraft 1.8.9 with Forge `11.15.1.2318`.
- JDK 8 for compiling and Java 8 for the legacy Forge runtime.
- Internet access on the first build so Gradle and ForgeGradle can download their dependencies.

This project intentionally retains the ForgeGradle 2.1 / Gradle 2.14.1 toolchain used by Forge 1.8.9. Newer JDKs and Gradle releases are not drop-in replacements for this legacy build.

## Build on Windows

Open Command Prompt in this folder and make sure `JAVA_HOME` points to a JDK 8 installation. Then run:

```bat
gradlew.bat clean build dumpTestClasspath
```

To run the standalone tests in Command Prompt:

```bat
tests\run-tests.bat
```

## Build on Linux or Git Bash

With JDK 8 selected, run:

```sh
./gradlew clean build dumpTestClasspath
TEST_CP="$(cat build/test-classpath.txt)" sh tests/run-tests.sh
```

The mod JAR is written to `build/libs/`. The generated `build/` and `.gradle/` directories are temporary and should not be included in source ZIPs.

## Installation

1. Start Minecraft 1.8.9 with Forge `11.15.1.2318` once.
2. Put `SkyVeLor-1.8.9-Beta-0.10.6v.jar` in the Minecraft `mods` folder.
3. Launch the Forge profile.

## Compatibility and testing limits

The project targets desktop Java 8. Android/Pojav compatibility is not verified. Automated tests cover logic, settings and configuration; they do not launch Minecraft or verify live-server behavior. Test rendering and gameplay in Minecraft 1.8.9 before publishing a release.

## License and credits

Both `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.txt` are retained from the supplied source archive. They contain different license texts (MIT and LGPL v3), so they must not be treated as interchangeable. Preserve upstream notices and verify the applicable license for each reused component before redistributing. Parts of the project were ported from RNG Carried Bald; existing attribution should remain with the relevant code.
